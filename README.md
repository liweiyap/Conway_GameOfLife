# Conway_GameOfLife

This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++. Build and run it directly with [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download).

## Description

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), "the **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970".

Given a board with *m* by *n* cells, each cell has an initial state *live* (1) or *dead* (0). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) using the following four rules:

</p>

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population *(inability to reproduce?)*.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation *(ideal population density)*.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population *(scarce nutrients)*.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction *(ideal population density)*.

* Qt Creator (tested with version 4.15.0)

## Acknowlegements

My UI design follows very closely that of [Anjana Sofia Vakil](http://vakila.github.io/rc-projects/game-of-life/). The source code and the implementation, however, are different; hers is in any case made in JavaScript.
